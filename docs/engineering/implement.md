## What it does

`implement` builds the work described in a spec or a set of tickets — driving it through test-driven development, typechecking, and the full test suite — then closes its own loop: it commits the green build and runs a bounded review-and-fix cycle over the run's diff before reporting out.

It does **not** decide what to build. The spec is already settled and the seams are already agreed; `implement` executes that plan rather than reopening it. It is the hands, not the head — the thinking happened upstream.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/implement` — the agent won't reach for it on its own.

Reach for it once the work is written down as a spec or split into tickets and you're ready to turn that into code. If the spec doesn't exist yet, write it first — for that, use [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec), or [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) to break a spec into tickets. If you just want to build something test-first without a full spec, drop to [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) directly.

## Pre-agreed seams

The idea `implement` runs on is the **seam** — the stable interface a feature is tested at, chosen before any code is written. It doesn't invent seams mid-build; it uses the ones already picked (during [to-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec)) and writes tests against them via [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd). Working at pre-agreed seams is what keeps the implementation honest: the tests target something durable, so the code underneath can move without the tests moving.

Around that core it keeps the loop tight — typecheck often, run single test files as it goes, run the whole suite once at the end — then commits the green build to the current branch and hands the diff to the review-fix loop.

## The review-fix loop

A run starts by pinning the current commit; everything the run produces is reviewed against that SHA, so it behaves the same on a branch, a worktree, or a detached HEAD. Once the build is committed, [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) runs over the run's diff — up to three rounds. Hard findings are always fixed: Spec findings go back through [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) because they are behaviour changes, standards violations are fixed directly because they are refactors under green tests. Judgement-call smells get exactly that — a judgement: the agent fixes the ones it finds relevant and records why it dismissed the rest. Each round's fixes are committed before the next review, and the loop stops early once a round reports no hard findings. The run ends with a report of what was fixed, what was dismissed and why, and anything still open after the cap.

## Where it fits

`implement` is the build step near the end of the main chain, just before the review:

```txt
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement → code-review
```

Reach for it after the work has been specced and sequenced, not before. Its key neighbours are [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which produces the tickets — each declaring its blocking edges — that it works through, and [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd), which it drives internally to write the tests at each seam before committing the build and closing out with its own [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) fix loop. When you're unsure which skill or flow fits, [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes you.
